The Algorithms
==============

The algorithms used in LongNum correspond to those traditionally 
used in manual arithmetics, such as longhand addition, 
longhand subtraction, longhand multiuplication and longhhaand division.
In addition to that, there is also the implementation of a longhand square root.
